# Project Motivation and Vision

## Background
This project focuses on developing a spam detection system for SMS messages. While SMS spam might seem like a solved problem, it remains relevant for building foundational skills in NLP and classification tasks.

## Problem Statement
The challenge is to create an effective binary classifier for SMS messages that:
- Accurately distinguishes between spam and legitimate messages
- Handles class imbalance effectively
- Provides interpretable results

## Personal Motivation
This project serves as:
- A practical application of machine learning concepts
- An introduction to NLP tasks
- A foundation for more complex classification problems

## Current Objectives
1. Build and evaluate baseline models
2. Address class imbalance challenges
3. Implement effective text preprocessing
4. Compare different model approaches

## Development Approach
- Start with simple, interpretable models
- Focus on solid evaluation metrics
- Iterative improvement based on results
- Document findings and insights

## Future Extensions
After establishing strong baseline performance:
- Experiment with advanced NLP techniques
- Explore more sophisticated model architectures
- Consider multi-platform applications

This project aims to build a strong foundation in text classification while maintaining room for future enhancements and applications.
