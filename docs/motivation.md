# SMS Spam Detection Project

## Background
This project develops a spam detection system for SMS messages to build foundational NLP and classification skills.

## Problem Statement
Create a binary classifier for SMS messages that:
- Accurately identifies spam vs legitimate messages
- Handles class imbalance
- Provides interpretable results

## Personal Motivation
Building on experience from text analysis projects ([Word Cloud Visualization](https://nayeonkwonds.medium.com/deep-dive-into-word-cloud-creation-c2fc7fc09c12), [Travel Blog Analysis](https://nayeonkwonds.medium.com/web-scraping-and-text-analysis-of-travel-trends-on-blogs-e83a453d34ed)) and binary classification work ([SME Closure Prediction](https://github.com/KwonNayeon/numble)), this project aims to deepen NLP expertise and classification techniques. The goal is to expand practical knowledge in text processing, model evaluation, and implementation of various classification approaches.

## Current Objectives
1. Build and evaluate baseline models
2. Address class imbalance challenges
3. Implement effective text preprocessing
4. Compare different model approaches

## Development Approach
- Start with simple, interpretable models
- Focus on solid evaluation metrics
- Iterative improvement based on results
- Document findings and insights

## Future Extensions
After establishing baseline performance:
- Experiment with advanced NLP techniques
- Explore sophisticated model architectures
- Consider multi-platform applications

This project aims to build strong foundations in text classification while allowing for future enhancements.
